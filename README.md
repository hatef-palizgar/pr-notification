# PR Notification üîî

[![PR Notifications](https://github.com/hatef-palizgar/pr-notification-poc/actions/workflows/pr-notification.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hatef-palizgar/pr-notification-poc/actions/workflows/pr-notification.yml)

A GitHub Action that automatically extracts service information from pull request titles and notifies relevant Slack channels based on the affected services.

## Features ‚ú®

- Extracts service names from PR titles
- Maps services to notification Slack channels using a configurable mapping file
- Extracts JIRA ticket numbers from PR titles
- Supports multiple services in a single PR
- Provides debug information for easier troubleshooting
- Automatically sends notifications to configured Slack channels

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. The action is triggered when a pull request is created or updated
2. It extracts service names from the PR title (content within parentheses)
3. Using the `service-mapping.yaml` file, it maps each service to its corresponding notification Slack channel
4. If present, it also extracts and includes the JIRA ticket number (format: QRND-XXXX) in the notification
5. The workflow then sends notifications to the identified Slack channels using the Slack GitHub Action

## Prerequisites ‚ö°

- A Slack Bot Token with appropriate permissions (stored as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in repository secrets)
- Properly configured Slack channels that match the mapping in `service-mapping.yaml`

## Repository Visibility Configuration üîí

### For Private Repositories
If you're using this action in a private repository, you'll need to:
1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope:
   - Go to GitHub.com ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
   - Generate a new token with `repo` scope
   - Copy the token value
2. Add the token as a repository secret:
   - Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Create a new secret named `QUINICORN_ACTIONS` [^1]
   - Paste your token value

[^1]: Check with your DevOps team for the correct secret name and if they are already configured.

### For Public Repositories
If your repository is public, no additional configuration is needed. The workflow will work out of the box.

## Example PR Title Format üìù

```
feat(service1, service2, QRND-1234): add new feature
```

## Local Testing with Act üß™

To test this GitHub Action locally, you can use the `act` tool. Here's how but for learning the act tool, check the [official documentation](https://github.com/nektos/act):

1. Install act (MacOS):
```bash
brew install act
```

2. List all workflows in the repository:
```bash
act -l --container-architecture linux/amd64
```

3. Create a pull request event simulation file `event.json`:
```json
{
  "pull_request": {
    "number": 123,
    "user": {
      "login": "hatef-palizgar"
    },
    "title": "feat(time-punch, QRND-4568): add new feature",
    "body": "This pull request introduces a new feature that significantly improves the performance of data processing tasks. Key changes include optimized algorithms and refined data structures.",
    "html_url": "https://github.com/hatef-palizgar/PR/123",
    "head": {
      "ref": "feature"
    },
    "base": {
      "ref": "main"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Run the action with your Slack token and event file:
```bash
act pull_request -s SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your-slack-token> --container-architecture linux/amd64 -e event.json
```

## Usage üìã

### 1. Service Mapping Configuration

Create or modify the `service-mapping.yaml` file in `.github/actions/extract-pr-data/` directory:

```yaml
# Map your services to Slack channels
service-name: slack-channel-name
another-service: another-channel
```

### 2. PR Title Format

The action expects PR titles to follow this format:
```
type(service1, service2, QRND-XXXX): description
```

Where:
- `type`: The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, chore)
- `service1, service2`: One or more service names in parentheses (must match names in service-mapping.yaml)
- `QRND-XXXX`: Optional JIRA ticket number
- `description`: Brief description of the changes

Examples:
```
feat(meal-break, QRND-1234): add new feature
fix(overtime-methods): fix bug in calculation
chore(salaries, time-punch): update dependencies
```

### 3. Workflow Setup

1. Add the workflow file to `.github/workflows/pr-notification.yml`
2. Configure required secrets:
   - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Slack Bot User OAuth Token
   - `QUINICORN_ACTIONS`: Personal/Organisation GitHub PAT with `repo` scope

### 4. Slack Channel Setup

1. Create the necessary Slack channels that match your service-mapping.yaml
2. Ensure the bot has necessary permissions:
   - `chat:write`
   - `chat:write.public`

## Notification Format üì¨

The Slack notification includes:
- PR Title
- PR Number
- Repository Name
- Author
- JIRA Ticket (if present) with link
- `View Pull Request` button


## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues

1. **No Notification Sent**
   - Check if service names in PR title match service-mapping.yaml
   - Verify Slack bot token permissions
   - Ensure bot scope includes `chat:write.public`

2. **Invalid Channel Error**
   - Verify channel names in service-mapping.yaml exist in Slack
   - Check if bot has access to the channels

3. **Service Not Recognized**
   - Ensure service names in PR title exactly match service-mapping.yaml
   - Check for typos or case mismatches
